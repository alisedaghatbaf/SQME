# SQME

SQME is a framework for automatic evaluation of software architecture models. The framework uses evolutionary algorithms for architecture improvement, evidence theory for uncertainty handling, and EV/TOPSIS for making trade-off decisions. This repository includes the src code of the Eclipse/Papyrus plugin developed to support SQME.
